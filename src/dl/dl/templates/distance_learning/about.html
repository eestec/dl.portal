<p>Distance Learning is an online learning platform aiming to spread the knowledge that exists within EESTEC and its academic or industrial partners.</p>

<p>The essence of Distance Learning is summarized in the following motto: <strong>“connect.play.learn”</strong>; because everything around it is as simple as that. Connect to <a href="http://dl.eestec.net/">http://dl.eestec.net/</a>, press the play button, learn about a scientific field of your interest.</p>

<p>Online education is a widely developed field in our times and aims to offer online university-level courses from a wide range of disciplines to a worldwide audience at no charge. That's the direction that education is moving to in our era and that's the path EESTEC wants to follow. So, the main objective of Distance Learning is to show how positively EESTEC is able to affect the academic life of every individual.</p>

<p>In order to achieve that, Distance Learning is offering recorded material from all the academic activities within EESTEC (e.g. lectures from international workshops, soft skills trainings etc) and online courses from distinguished professors and experts of the labor market. Live streaming service is often provided as well.</p>

<p>No matter who you are, where you are or when you are available, knowledge will be there, waiting for you.</p>
